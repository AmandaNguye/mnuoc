<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Me&UofC serves as a full stack web applciation to serve the needs of students attending the University of Calgary. Due to a perceived lack of social interaction between students over the course of the pandamenic, it was evident that students needed a channel to interact with their peers for their classes. This is the purpose for Me&UofC.

This appplicaiton is a reddit like community forum by which users are able to make posts. Users are also able to interact with other users posts and send direct messages to other users in the system. Admins manage each community.
